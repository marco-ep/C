  It appears that the stack grows toward
  the lower addresses and that the stack
  pointer points at the item that is at 
  the top of the stack.

  Here, the value 5 is NOT at estack but
  at the last slot in the stack array.
  The value 4 is in the penultimate slot.

  pushA :
      sp <- sp-2
      memory[sp] <- Accumulator

  popA :
      Accumulator <-  memory[sp]
      sp <- sp+2

  Run this code with the trace command...
  t 8
  should be fine and then 
  dw f 30

          cseg

          ldAi estack   ;
          xchAS         ;

          ldAi    5     ;
          pushA         ;
          ldAi    4     ;
          pushA         ;

done      jmp    done   ;


          dseg
stack     rw 10          ;
estack    rw  1          ;

          end
